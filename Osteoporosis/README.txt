Osteoporosis Knee X-ray database, which comprises of three subfolders: Normal, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis and Ms-excel sheet of 240 subjects.
* Folder “Normal” includes Knee X-ray Images of participants with normal BMD. 
Total X-ray images: 36

* Folder “Osteopenia” includes Knee X-ray Images of participants with low BMD. 
Total X-ray images: 154

* Folder “Osteoporosis” includes Knee X-ray Images of participants with induced Osteoporosis.
Total X-ray images: 49

* Ms-Excel sheet “patient details” include:  clinical, demographic, lifestyle, nutritional information, and other risk factors of each participant along with the T-score obtained from Quantitative Ultrasound System and diagnosis on the basis of T-score.

* The nomenclature of the “Normal” includes the following information:
-BMDlevel-SubjectID
For example, the image file  “N1” represents Knee X-ray scan of a participant with normal BMD and ID of 1 in this class.   

* The nomenclature of the “Osteopenia” includes the following information:
-BMDlevel-SubjectID
For example, the image file  “OP1” represents the Knee X-ray scan of a participant with low BMD i.e Osteopenia and ID of 1 in this class.   
* The nomenclature of the “Osteoporosis” includes the following information:
-BMDlevel-SubjectID
For example, the image file  “OS1” represents the Knee X-ray scan of a participant with very low BMD i.e Osteoporosis and ID of 1 in this class.   

* The nomenclature of “patient details” includes the following information:
-BMDlevel-SubjectID
For example, the image file  “OS1” represents the details of Osteoporosis participant with ID of 1, “OP1” represents the details of osteopenia participant with ID of 1 and “N1” represent the details of normal participant with ID of 1.  
 The BMDlevel and IDs of participants in “Subfolders” and “Ms-excel sheet” represents the same sample.
